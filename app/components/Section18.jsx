        Do Not Sell My Personal Information

      <p>
        We do not sell personal information. However, the Service Providers we
        partner with (for example, our advertising partners) may use technology
        on the Service that "sells" personal information as defined by the CCPA
        law. <br />
        <br />
        If you wish to opt out of the use of your personal information for
        interest-based advertising purposes and these potential sales as defined
        under CCPA law, you may do so by following the instructions below.
